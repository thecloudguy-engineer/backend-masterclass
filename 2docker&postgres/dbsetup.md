## Setting up postgresql by using docker container

This is second tutorial in the backend master class series. I did use docker from before and familar with docker ps and docker run commands. 

Learnt about alpine version. Generally you dont need full blown OS like ubunutu to run postgresql. Light weight linux version such as alpine works. This will definitely reduce startup times.
This is one of the topics I came across doing a practice test for GCP
